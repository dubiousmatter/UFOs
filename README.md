# UFOs

## Overview
Our goal was to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. So, we essentially needed to build two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data using HTML and a dynamic table that will present it via JavaScript.

## Results
Our webpage now includes the ability to filter on several different criteria including:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

Given that there are a massive amount of sightings recorded, this filtering capability let's the user locate data in smaller, more manageable chunks. One example would be filtering for Roswell, NM on January 1, 2010 as seen in the image below.

The search returns two data points as opposed to hundreds and can easily be analyzed by the user.

## Summary
The webpage is fully functional, however, there are many dates and cities that do not return any data. Further development ideas for the site might include the ability to filter based on a date range and proximity to a city based upon user mileage input.
